# Case-Study---Portfolio-Optimization-with-Python
I build two $10,000 portfolios with four stocks: one equally weighted and one optimized for the best risk-adjusted return. The process includes importing two years of stock data, analyzing and visualizing the equal-weighted portfolio, generating 10,000 random portfolio scenarios, and identifying the optimal portfolio with visualizations.
